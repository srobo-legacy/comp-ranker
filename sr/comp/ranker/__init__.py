    ``zpoints`` is a dictionary from some key (typically a zone or corner name)
    to game points [#gp_type]_. ``dsq_list``, if provided, is a list of keys of
    teams or zones that have been disqualified and are therefore considered
    below last place.

    A mapping from positions to an iterable of teams in that position is
    returned.

    .. note::
       In case of a tie, both teams are awarded the same position, as is usual
       in sport. That is, if team A has 3 points, team B has 3 points and team
       C has 1 point, then teams A and B are both awarded 1\ :sup:`st`, and C
       is awarded 3\ :sup:`rd`.

    .. [#gp_type] Usually a numeric type, but can be any type that is
       comparable and usable as a key for dictionaries.
