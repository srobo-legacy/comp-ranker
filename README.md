Given a collection of entrants and their scores,
 it will sort them and return their ranked points

The mechanism used to alocate the ranked points is (quote taken from the
[Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org)
[rulebook](https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/rules)).

> The team with the **most** game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league.
> The team with the second most will be awarded 6.
> The team with the third most will be awarded 4 points, and the team with the fewest game points will be awarded 2 points.
> Teams whose robot was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded no points.
>
> Tied robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined positions would be awarded.
> Thus, three robots tied for first place would receive 6 points each (since this is `(8+6+4)/3`).

As a result, the ranked points for an entrant (team) might not be an integer.
However, for 4 entrants the value will always be an integer.

It supports Python 2.7 and 3.x.

### Tests
Tests can be run by running `./run-tests`, which relies on nose.
